    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the last lesson we learned how to iterate over collections. In this one, we'll get some hands on practice applying different transformations to data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Remember that this is a lab, so you need to work locally (fork, clone, cd into the directory, run `jupyter notebook`, open the `index.ipynb` file in the browser).*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Iterate over common Python collection types\n",
    "* Use list comprehensions to clean up lists\n",
    "* Create and iterate over collections of collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by setting you up with some data to work with. Make sure to run the cell below so that the variables are declared and available to you in your code:"

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You got a whole bunch of practice iterating over collections and retrieving data from them! This week we created a really solid foundation for the rest of the course. We ensured that everyone had Jupyter Notebook set up and working, introduced variables, data types and some common operations for data cleaning. We also learned about collections and how to iterate over them to clean up data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next week we're going to introduce you to some more powerful data types for working with data and how to use regular expressions to perform more sophisticated data clean up. By the end of next week you're going to be importing a data set, iterating over it, cleaning it up and saving it to a file like a pro!\n"
