    "In the last lesson we learned how to iterate over collections. In this one, we'll get some hands on practice applying different transformations to data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Remember that this is a lab, so you need to work locally (fork, clone, cd into the directory, run `jupyter notebook`, open the `index.ipynb` file in the browser).*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Iterate over common Python collection types\n",
    "* Use list comprehensions to clean up lists\n",
    "* Create and iterate over collections of collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by setting you up with some data to work with. Make sure to run the cell below so that the variables are declared and available to you in your code:"
